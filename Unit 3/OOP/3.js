/*Write a Lambdasian class.
Its constructor takes a single argument - an object with the following keys:
name
age
location
Its constructor should initialize name, age and location properties on the instance.
Instances of Lambdasian should be able to .speak():
Speaking should return a phrase Hello my name is {name}, I am from {location}.
{name} and {location} of course come from the instance's own properties.*/

class object{
    constructor(name,age,location){
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.location = location;
    }
}

class Lambdasian{
    constructor(object){
        this.name = object.name;
        this.age = object.age;
        this.location = object.location;
    }

    speak(){
        return `Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}`
    }
}

o = new object("Sergio", 22,"Granada");
lam = new Lambdasian(o);
